This folder contains to SQL scripts written using MySQL Workbench.  The first SQL script, "SalesTables_SQLCleanUP", converts the CSV files generated by the Python scripts into tables for usage within MySQL, as well as doing some minor data cleaning and formating to the tables for ease of use.

The second SQL script, "SalesTables_NewTableGenerations", creates 3 new tables.  All three new tables can be found in the data folder as CSV files.  The first of which, "vgsales_clean_dates", is the initially generated "vgsales" table with dates cleaned and formatted into a YYYY-MM-DD format.  

The second table, found as "BestSellingConsoles_UpdatedPlatCol", is an updated version of the "BestSellingConsoles" table, with the "Platform" column values modifided to have better compatibility with the "vgsales_clean_dates" table.

The final table "BestSellingGamesPerConsole", identifies and pulls he best selling game on each platform, as well as the sales of each platform that game launched on.
