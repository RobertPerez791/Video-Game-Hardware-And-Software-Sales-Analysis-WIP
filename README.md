# Video-Game-Hardware-And-Software-Sales-Analysis-WIP
A personal data analysis and visualization project using video game hardware and software sells.  

Video game software sales are retreived from https://www.vgchartz.com/games, while hardware sales are retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles.

Both datasets are created using python and the beautifulsoup, numpy, and pandas package.  CSV datasets are dated up tp 1/20.

Currently a work in progress.
